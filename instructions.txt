1. Decide on the number of rounds you want to play.
2. At the start of each round, the player (you) selects either rock, paper, or scissors.
3. The computer randomly selects one of rock, paper, or scissors.
4. Compare the player's choice with the computer's choice according to the traditional rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
5. The result of each round is stored and added on each time:
   - Player wins: +1 point to player
   - Computer wins: +1 point to computer
   - Tie: No points awarded
6. Repeat steps 2-6 until the predetermined number of rounds is reached.
7. Once all rounds are played, determine the overall winner:
   - The player with the most points wins.
   - In case of a tie, declare the game as a draw.
